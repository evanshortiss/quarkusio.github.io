                Just before my PTO, someone told me: 'I don&#8217;t like magic.' In this context, magic refers to the amount of hidden stuff done by Quarkus under the hood for the sake of simplicity.

                A few months back, I blogged about Quarkus, Kafka, and Avro (using the Apicurio schema registry). We developed a simple application, receives HTTP requests, writes Kafka records, and reads them from Kafka. It uses Avro to serialize and deserialize the records. At that time, the application was NOT working in...
